## Starlight Database Engine 
#### NOTE: THIS DATABASE ENGINE IS NOWHERE NEAR BEING PRODUCTION READY AND WILL PROBABLY NEVER WILL BE (considering javascript is not exactly the most performant language)


**An extremely fast, distributed, `key value pair` or`json document`, realtime database engine with a lightning fast pub/sub mechanism with a socketIO or http interface**


This database aims to be a free, open source alternative to the firebase realtime database to allow for extremely quick retrieval for documents and **being able to respond to document changes** through a **socketIO based** event emitter. (Although this will probably be changed in favor of websockets).

The default PORT for Starlight is: `4555`

**How to use the Starlight Engine**

1.**Clone the current repository by doing `git clone https://github.com/penguindetox/StarlightEngine.git`**
